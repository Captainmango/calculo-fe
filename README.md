# Calculo FE

This is the frontend for Calculo. It uses Next.js and Materialize CSS for styling. State is managed with Zustand, following the redux pattern as closely as possible.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Without the backend launched, this app will not do much. Branch and pull calculoAPI and run locally before running the repo.
